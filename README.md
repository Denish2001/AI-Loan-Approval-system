ALAS: Automated Loan Approval System (Python & Tkinter)
This repository contains the source code for the ALAS project, an automated loan approval system designed to streamline loan processing within the Kenyan banking sector.
The system utilizes Python and the Tkinter library for a user-friendly graphical interface.

Project Overview

Objective: Develop a user-friendly system leveraging machine learning for loan approval decisions, enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction for Kenyan banks.
Technology Stack: Python, Tkinter (GUI), scikit-learn (machine learning)
Target Users: Loan officers and potential loan applicants (future versions will implement role-based access control)
Current Stage: Prototype

Getting Started

Prerequisites:
Python 3 (version 3.x recommended)
Tkinter (included with most Python installations)
Additional libraries may be required for data analysis (depending on your implementation) - scikit-learn is a common choice for machine learning tasks.
You can install required libraries using pip install <library_name>.
